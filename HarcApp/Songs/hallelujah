really care for music do you?\n\nIt goes like this, the fourth, the fifth\nThe minor fall, the major lift\nThe baffled King composing Hallelujah\n\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\nYour faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty in the moonlight overthrew you\n\nShe tied you to a kitchen chair\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the hallelujah\n\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\nMaybe I’ve been here before\nI know this room, I’ve walked this floor\nI used to live alone before I knew you\n\nI’ve seen your flag on the marble arch\nLove is not a victory march\nIt’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah\n\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\nThere was a time when you let me know\nWhat’s real and going on below\nBut now you never show it to me, do you?\n\nAnd remember when I moved in you\nThe Holy Dark was moving too\nAnd every breath we drew was hallelujah\n\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\nMaybe there’s a God above\nAnd all I ever learned from love\nWas how to shoot at someone who outdrew you\n\nAnd it’s not a cry you can hear at night\nIt’s not somebody who’s seen the light\nIt’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah\n\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah\n\tHallelujah, hallelujah","refrenChordsAsString":"F a\nF C G
